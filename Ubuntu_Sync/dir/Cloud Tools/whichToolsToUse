Docker advantages:
Less configuration drifts (Doesn't need to use different versions in configurations)
Deploys an entire new image to avoid configuration drifts which makes debugging easier and reusable and readable

Docker disadvanges:
Recreating an entire image for a minor change is not ideal
Configuration drifts are only reduced in deployment, but not while the image is running and being updated

Terraform advantages:
Declarative Over Procedural means no figuring out each script and order
Procedural languages like Ansible will try to add/remove things in addition to the current configuration
This can cause the scripts to be harder to read like having 10 instances and trying to add to get to 15, but you get 25
Terraform will only add enough to reach the desired state (15) by adding 5 instances
