Collision Domains - Seperated Links lead to less collisions on that link
L2 and above devices can seperate each link through unicast causing less collisions

Broadcast Domains - Seperated Networks lead to less traffic congestion on the network
L3 devices ( & VLANS ) are the only ones which seperate networks into its own network 
which leads to less traffic on the network

Hubs are the worst in both since they do not seperate either domain

		Collision Domains	Broadcast Domains
Hubs		1			1
Bridges		1 per port		1
Switches	1 per port		1
L3 Switches	1 per port		1 per port
Routers		1 per port		1 per port
