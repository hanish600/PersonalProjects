To restructure acl lists:
ip access-list resequence acl_number-name start_num increment

*** Note *** : It is recommended to allow space between sequences for additional entries
Also It is recommended for extended acls to be close to the source while standard acls are close to the destination

Use ip named acls for ease
Use extended acl for more options on filtering instead of only source/dest ip

Standard ACLs : 0-99 	1300-1999
Extended ACLs : 100-199 2000-2699
