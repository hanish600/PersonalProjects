CAT3 = 10Base-T = 10 Mbps/100m
CAT5 = 100Base-T = 100 Mbps/100m
CAT5e = 1GBase-T = 1 Gbps/100m
CAT6 = 10GBase-T OR 1GBase-T = 10Gbps/55m or 1Gbps/100m
CAT6A = 10GBase-T = 10GBps/100m
CAT7 = 10GBase-T = 10GBps/100m
CAT8 = 40GBase-T = 40GBps/30m

USE MMF for long distance (A few hundred meters)
USE SMF for very long distance (A few KM) 
SMF = 8-10 u (Yellow)
MMF = 50-100 u (Blue or Orange)
SMF = Very Long Range + High Speed + Single mode
MMF = Long range + Multi mode

SFP = 4.25 Gbps
SFP+ = 16 Gbps
QSFP = 40-200+ Gbps

AVOID APC + UPC COMBO FOR BEST PERFORMANCE
Angled Physical Contact tilts cable by 8 degree to avoid reflection
Ultra Physical Contact can cause reflection
